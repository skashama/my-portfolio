                <p>I attended PSC in Little Rock, AR and graduated with a bachelor of science in Computer Science. Iâ€™ve had a chance to travel across the country from Washington, DC to Seattle, WA. I ran into great people, built friendships, exchanged ideas.</p>
                <p>Through it all, technology made it easy for us to keep in contact. This gave me more than a reason to dedicate myself on using web technologies to build products and services to maintain communities.</p>
